R interface to a [quantum random number service](https://qrng.physik.hu-berlin.de/download) hosted by the Humboldt university in Berlin.

You need to register for this site, but otherwise the random numbers are for free. I guess the registration serves the purpose that you don't get the same random numbers twice.
